    "text": "In modern science, software-based research is playing an increasingly central role. The professional development and competent use of software are crucial for progress in nearly all scientific disciplines. Accordingly, the professional profile of the Research Software Engineer (RSE) has emerged—characterized by a combination of expertise in software development and a deep understanding of scientific research processes. With the growing importance of this role, particularly in the context of emerging RSE service centers at and for research institutions, there is an increasing demand for dedicated Master’s programs in RSE or for the integration of RSE profiles into existing, thematically related Master’s programs.\nWe invite all members of the Research Software Engineering (RSE) community and interested scientists and educators to join us in developing a Master’s curriculum tailored to the unique needs, interests, and challenges of RSE. Each module represents a specific area of the RSE landscape and will be shaped by community-driven short online workshops (2–3 hours each).\nThe main idea is to supplement general courses on software engineering, data science and advanced science classes with RSE-specific courses tailored to the growing field of software engineering in research. Mapping necessary required basic courses is part the process.\nThese example modules will be new in structure and content and provide universities a suggestion how to hire and support the growing need for RSE competencies. These courses will be optional in the sense that alternatives or similar existing classes will be suggested if a specialized lecturer is not available.\nIn these workshops, we collaboratively define:\n\nRelevant competences\nSuggested course structures\nRSE-specific perspectives\n\nThese efforts will feed directly into the development of a comprehensive and inclusive RSE Master’s curriculum.

Key topics include which faculties or departments can grant the degree—whether it must be Computer Science or could extend to other disciplines under certain conditions. We’ll also define admission requirements and explore how interdisciplinary applicants can be accommodated.\nAnother focus will be on curriculum composition: Is there a way to structure levels of RSE competence similar to the German Informatics Society’s model for CS degrees? How should the program balance research (R) and software engineering (SE)? We’ll explore potential profiles or tracks and address how modular and flexible the curriculum should be."
