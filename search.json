    "text": "As part of the pilot for this RSE-in-master-education concept we are testing some of the courses developed here. For this particular course we found that there is vast literature available for management and communication purposes but not so much available tailored to RSE. For this reason, we decided to develop the application specifics together with the students following the inquiry-based learning paradigm (Brew 2003).\nIn order to achieve this in the most realistic fashion we ask the RSE community to provide us with case studies that contain human-level conflicts, management issues, communication failures or general political problems (maybe one page).\nYou can send this anonymously here https://gi.de/aktuelles/projekte/rse-master/praxisbeispiele-rse-management!\nThe case study can be old, and no real names, organisations or such should be mentioned. The idea is that the students can learn from real life situations making the course more realistic and useful as a pilot for RSE higher education. This way, you can become part in the project, and find out, what the students learned from literature that could have helped the situation (or not).\nIn order to standardize the submitted case studies we suggest the critical incident technique.\nAlternatively, you could agree to an interview by sending your confirmation to julian.dehne@gi.de.\nIt would be great if you could follow this schematics:\n\nFocus on a genuinely critical incident: Describe a situation that clearly deviated from everyday routine and had a significant positive or negative impact on the project, collaboration, or outcome. Routine difficulties or generic problems are less useful than moments of escalation, conflict, breakdown, or unexpected success.\nClearly state context and goal: Briefly outline the setting and intended goal of the work at the time of the incident (e.g. project phase, expectations, constraints). This allows students to assess why the incident mattered and what “success” or “failure” meant in that situation.\nDescribe observable behavior and interactions: Focus on what people did or said, not on general impressions or hindsight judgments. Describe actions, decisions, communication patterns, and reactions as concretely as possible, especially where management, power relations, or communication played a role.\nExplain consequences and perceived impact: Describe the immediate and longer-term outcomes of the incident: How did it affect the project, the team, or individuals involved? If relevant, include reflections on which behaviors contributed to success or failure — without assigning blame or naming real people or organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrew, Angela. 2003. “Teaching and Research: New Relationships and Their Implications for Inquiry-Based Teaching and Learning in Higher Education.” Higher Education Research  &  Development 22 (1): 3–18. https://doi.org/10.1080/0729436032000056571."

The professional development and competent use of software are crucial for progress in nearly all scientific disciplines. Accordingly, the professional profile of Research Software Engineers (RSEs) has emerged—characterized by a combination of expertise in software development and a deep understanding of scientific research processes. With the growing importance of this role, particularly in the context of emerging Research Software Engineering (RSE) service centers at and for research institutions, there is an increasing demand for dedicated Master’s programs in RSE or for the integration of RSE profiles into existing, thematically related Master’s programs.\nWe invite all members of the RSE community and interested scientists and educators to join us in developing a Master’s curriculum tailored to the unique needs, interests, and challenges of RSE. Each module represents a specific area of the RSE landscape and will be shaped by community-driven short online workshops (2–3 hours each).\nThe main idea is to supplement general courses on software engineering, data science and advanced science classes with RSE-specific courses tailored to the growing field of software engineering in research. Mapping necessary required basic courses is part the process.\nThese example modules will be new in structure and content and provide universities a suggestion how to hire and support the growing need for RSE competencies. These courses will be optional in the sense that alternatives or similar existing classes will be suggested if a specialized lecturer is not available.\nIn these workshops, we collaboratively define:\n\nRelevant competences\nSuggested course structures\nRSE-specific perspectives\n\nThese efforts will feed directly into the development of a comprehensive and inclusive RSE Master’s curriculum.

Perhaps someone here is an AI expert who can suggest more specific programmes?\n\n\n\nResearch Software Engineering\nThis module extends the Classical Software Engineering Module with research specific learnings. This may include but is not limited to\n\nAdapting the software life cycle to research (see SWLC in (Goth et al. 2024))\nSoftware behaviour awareness and analysis (see MOD in (Goth et al. 2024))\nResearch specific Engineering Patterns"

People working as RSE are often involved in digitalization projects, institutional development or other non-technical tasks.\nFor a university level study program it is fitting that students learn an abstract high-level understanding of their field so that they can adapt technical models, communication frameworks and policy recommendations to the complex cases. For this they need a solid understanding in some of the more theoretical fields such as …\n\nphilosophy of science\nsociology of technology\nethics and artificial intelligence\nhuman computer interaction\ndigital humanities\n\nThis module conveys competences in areas such as but not limited to …\n\nconducting and leading research (NEW)\nunderstanding the research cycle (RC)\ninteraction with users and stakeholders (USERS)"

We will discuss the typical program duration (two years in Germany) and whether alternatives—such as one- or three-year formats—should be considered.\nKey questions include:\n\nWhich faculties or departments are authorized to grant the degree? Should it be restricted to Computer Science, or could other disciplines also serve as the awarding body under certain conditions?\nWhat should the admission requirements be, particularly for applicants from interdisciplinary backgrounds?\n\nWe will also explore the composition of the curriculum:\n\nIs it possible to structure levels of RSE competence similarly to the German Informatics Society’s model for Computer Science degrees?\nHow should the program balance the research (R) and software engineering (SE) components?\nWhat profiles or tracks might be envisioned, and how modular and flexible should the curriculum be?"
