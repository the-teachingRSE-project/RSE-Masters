## Software Engineering for RSEs
This module extends the Classical Software Engineering Module with research specific learnings. This includes but is not limited to

- software re-use (see SRU in [@competencies-F1000])
- creating documented code building blocks (see DOCBB in [@competencies-F1000])
- building distributable software (see DIST in [@competencies-F1000])
- research specific programming languages
- research specific code requirements (scalability, functional programming, ...)
- Adapting the software life cycle to research (see SWLC in [@competencies-F1000])
- Software behaviour awareness and analysis (see MOD in [@competencies-F1000])
- Research specific Engineering Patterns

Also, the seminar provides room for reflection and discussions of SE lab experiences.
