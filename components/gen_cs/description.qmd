## Fundamentals of Computer Science

This module covers the basics of computer science and introduces the students from domain sciences to programming.

### Basic Concepts

- Introduction to computer science, basic concepts of operating systems using UNIX/Linux as an example
- From problem to algorithm: concept of an algorithm, design of algorithms, pseudocode, refinement, brute-force algorithms, models and modeling, graphs and their representation, simple algorithms on graphs, analysis of algorithms (correctness, termination, runtime)
- Implementation of algorithms (e.g., using Python)
- Programming paradigms: procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming; recursion versus iteration
- From program to process: assembly languages, assembler, compiler, interpreter, syntax and semantics of programming languages
- Limits of algorithms: computability, decidability, undecidability
