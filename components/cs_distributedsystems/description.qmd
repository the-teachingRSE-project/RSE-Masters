## Distributed Systems

### Introduction

This module deals with distributed IT systems.


### Contents

The module covers a selection of the following topics:

- Reliability of distributed systems: Concepts of distributed file systems, synchronization techniques for reliable distributed applications, concepts of load balancing in high-availability clusters,
- Example: Sensor networks: Routing in sensor networks, operating systems for sensor networks, security in sensor networks,
- Secure internet protocols (IP security (IPsec), Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Shell (SSH), DNS security (DNSsec)), secure IPv6 networks.


### Learning Objectives

- can evaluate existing distributed systems in terms of reliability and security and identify vulnerabilities.
- can correctly identify reliability and security requirements when designing new distributed systems and consider them early in the development process.


### Examination Methods

- either 120 min written exam
- or 20-30 min oral examination
