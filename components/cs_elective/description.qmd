## Compulsory Electives

### Introduction

Students in the cs-track have to choose a few advanced computer science modules.
These can include:
- [Complexity Theory](cs_complexitytheory.qmd)
- [Computer Vision](cs_computervision.qmd)
- [Declarative Programming](cs_declarativeprogramming.qmd)
- [Distributed Systems](cs_distributedsystems.qmd)
- [Efficient Algorithms](cs_efficientalgorithms.qmd)
- [Embedded Systems](cs_embeddedsystems.qmd)
- [Security and Cryptography](cs_securitycrypto.qmd)
- [Scientific Computing](rse_scientificcomputing.qmd)

Contents, competences and examination methods depend on the chosen modules.
Obviously, every module can be completed only once.
