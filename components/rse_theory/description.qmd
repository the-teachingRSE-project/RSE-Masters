## RSE Theory

The RSE master program is more than a computer science specialisation for researchers. People working as RSE are often involved
in digitalization projects, institutional development or other non-technical tasks.

For a university level study program it is fitting that students learn an abstract high-level understanding of their
field so that they can adapt technical models, communication frameworks and policy recommendations to the complex cases.
For this they need a solid understanding in some of the more theoretical fields such as ...

- philosophy of science
- sociology of technology
- ethics and artificial intelligence
- human computer interaction
- digital humanities

This module conveys competences in areas such as but not limited to ...

- conducting and leading research (NEW)
- understanding the research cycle (RC)
- interaction with users and stakeholders (USERS)
