- Data types, type casting, control structures, functions and procedures, parameter passing paradigms, call stack
- Pointers, arrays, strings, structured types
- Errors and their handling
- Dynamic memory management
- Program libraries

#### Programming in an Object-Oriented Language (e.g., Java)

- Classes, objects, constructors
- Inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes/interfaces
- Exceptions and exception handling
- Namespaces (packages)
- Generic classes and types
- Program libraries
