## RSE, Ethics & Society
### Introduction

The RSE master's program is more than a computer science specialisation for researchers. People working as RSEs are often involved in digitalization projects, institutional development or other non-technical tasks. Also, introducing students to cutting-edge technologies, raises ethical questions. To talk about the impact of RSE on society, is therefore crucial. This module addresses the social context of RSEng. Students examine issues relating to sustainability, ethics, responsibility and the impact of new technologies. 
The module provides space for student-driven projects that address social challenges such as green tech and artificial intelligence, and encourages reflection on the role of RSEng in science and society.
It offers space for engagement with current challenges that are constantly changing but should be part of a curriculum in the age of digitalisation
